### My-First-Angular2-CRUD-App:
In this sample angular2 application I implemented the simple CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Delete) by using almost all main features of angular2. Furthermore, It helped me to start building data driven web application using angular2.

**Application Architecture:**

**Running the application:**


You can download or clone the code from the repository (https://github.com/aamir-poswal/My-First-Angular2-CRUD-App), then open the project with visual studio code and in integrated terminal type 'npm install' to download all the packages required to build this application, and then type 'npm start' to start the application.
